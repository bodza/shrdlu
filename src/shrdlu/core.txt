Excerpt from the  PROVISIONAL SHRDLU USERS' MANUAL (see file shrdlu/manual):

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SHRDLU
---------------------------

         SHRDLU IS A SYSTEM FOR THE  COMPUTER  UNDERSTANDING
    OF  ENGLISH.    THE  SYSTEM  ANSWERS QUESTIONS, EXECUTES
    COMMANDS, AND  ACCEPTS  INFORMATION  IN  NORMAL  ENGLISH
    DIALOG.    IT  USES  SEMANTIC INFORMATION AND CONTEXT TO
    UNDERSTAND DISCOURSE AND TO DISAMBIGUATE SENTENCES.   IT
    COMBINES  A COMPLETE SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS OF EACH SENTENCE
    WITH A "HEURISTIC  UNDERSTANDER"  WHICH  USES  DIFFERENT
    KINDS  OF  INFORMATION  ABOUT A SENTENCE, OTHER PARTS OF
    THE DISCOURSE, AND GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT  THE  WORLD
    IN DECIDING WHAT THE SENTENCE MEANS.

         SHRDLU  IS  BASED  ON  THE  BELIEF  THAT A COMPUTER
    CANNOT DEAL  REASONABLY  WITH  LANGUAGE  UNLESS  IT  CAN
    "UNDERSTAND"  THE  SUBJECT IT IS DISCUSSING. THE PROGRAM
    IS GIVEN A DETAILED MODEL OF THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED  BY  A
    SIMPLE  ROBOT  HAVING  ONLY A HAND AND AN EYE.  THE USER
    CAN GIVE IT  INSTRUCTIONS  TO  MANIPULATE  TOY  OBJECTS,
    INTERROGATE  IT ABOUT THE SCENE, AND GIVE IT INFORMATION
    IT WILL USE IN DEDUCTION.  IN ADDITION  TO  KNOWING  THE
    PROPERTIES  OF  TOY  OBJECTS,  THE  PROGRAM HAS A SIMPLE
    MODEL OF  ITS  OWN  MENTALITY.    IT  CAN  REMEMBER  AND
    DISCUSS ITS PLANS AND ACTIONS AS WELL AS CARRY THEM OUT.
    IT ENTERS INTO A DIALOG WITH  A  PERSON,  RESPONDING  TO
    ENGLISH  SENTENCES WITH ACTIONS AND ENGLISH REPLIES, AND
    ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION  WHEN  ITS  HEURISTIC  PROGRAMS
    CANNOT  UNDERSTAND A SENTENCE THROUGH USE OF CONTEXT AND
    PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE.

         IN THE PROGRAMS, SYNTAX, SEMANTICS,  AND  INFERENCE
    ARE INTEGRATED IN A "VERTICAL" SYSTEM IN WHICH EACH PART
    IS CONSTANTLY COMMUNICATING WITH THE OTHERS. SHRDLU USES
    SYSTEMIC  GRAMMAR, A TYPE OF SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS WHICH IS
    DESIGNED  TO  DEAL  WITH   SEMANTICS.      RATHER   THAN
    CONCENTRATING  ON  THE EXACT FORM OF RULES FOR THE SHAPE
    OF LINGUISTIC  CONSTITUENTS,  IT  IS  STRUCTURED  AROUND
    CHOICES   FOR  CONVEYING  MEANING.    IT  ABSTRACTS  THE
    RELEVANT FEATURES OF THE LINGUISTIC STRUCTURES WHICH ARE
    IMPORTANT FOR INTERPRETING THEIR MEANING.

         IN  SHRDLU  MANY KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE ARE REPRESENTED
    IN THE FORM OF PROCEDURES RATHER THAN TABLES OF RULES OR
    LISTS  OF  PATTERNS.    BY DEVELOPING SPECIAL PROCEDURAL
    LANGUAGES FOR GRAMMAR, SEMANTICS, AND  DEDUCTIVE  LOGIC,
    THE  FLEXIBILITY  AND  POWER OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES IS
    GAINED    WHILE    RETAINING    THE    REGULARITY    AND
    UNDERSTANDABILITY  OF SIMPLER RULE FORMS.  EACH PIECE OF
    KNOWLEDGE CAN BE A PROCEDURE, AND CAN CALL ON ANY  OTHER
    PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE SYSTEM.

IMPLEMENTATION AND VERSION INFORMATION
--------------------------------------

        SHRDLU  WAS  PROGRAMMED  AT   THE   MIT   ARTIFICIAL
    INTELLIGENCE  LABORATORY  BY  T.   WINOGRAD AS PART OF A
    DOCTORAL DISSERTATION IN MATHEMATICS.

        THE PROGRAM WAS MODIFIED DURING THE LAST YEAR BY  T.
    WINOGRAD,  D.  MACDONALD, J. HILL, AND S. CARD TO CHANGE
    SOME OF ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS  AND  TO  MAKE  THE
    CODE  EASIER  TO UNDERSTAND FOR PERSONS WISHING TO STUDY
    THE PROGRAM.  NO MAJOR ATTEMPTS WERE  MADE  TO  INCREASE
    ITS POWER.

        THE PROGRAM RUNNING AT C-MU IS THE MODIFIED VERSION.
    THE DISPLAY FACILITIES OF  THE  PROGRAM  HAVE  NOT  BEEN
    IMPLEMENTED  AT  C-MU.  THE PROGRAM WAS COAXED AWAY FROM
    MIT'S  INCOMPATIBLE  TIME-SHARING   SYSTEM   (ITS)   AND
    CONVERTED  TO RUN UNDER THE DEC TOPS10 (10-50) OPERATING
    SYSTEM BY CONVERTING MACLISP ITSELF  (AND  TO  DO  THAT,
    CONVERTING  THE  MIDAS  ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE).  THE MACLISP
    CONVERSION WAS DONE BY GEORGE ROBERTSON.

THE VERSION OF SHRDLU BEING DISTRIBUTED FROM  CMU  IS  NAMED
    THE  C1  VERSION.  IT IS CURRENT WITH THE MIT VERSION TO
    JUNE 1972.  THE SHOW AND TELL USER INTERFACE AND VARIOUS
    CHANGES   WERE  ADDED  FOR  THE  C-MU  WORKSHOP  ON  NEW
    TECHNOLOGIES IN COGNITIVE RESEARCH IN JUNE 1972.

        SHRDLU IS  WRITTEN  IN  MACLISP  1.6  (VINTAGE  JUNE
    1972).  IT USES ABOUT 100 TO 140K 36-BIT WORDS OF MEMORY
    ON A PDP-10.

-There is no working version of the entire SHRDLU program because
there is no working implementation of MICROPLANNER. Contributions
of same gladly accepted.

-There is, however, a working version of the PROGRAMMAR parser and
grammar that Terry and I developed. It lives as SHRDL1;TS PARSER
and is relatively self-explanitory when started from DDT.

-This directory contains the expr code for the entire SHRDLU system
plus what documentation was ever written and a cross-INDEX'ing.
Requests are often made for the system by people at other instalations
and i send them the contents of this directory

    What should the second form in the following read as?

        (push :mumble *features*)
        '(#-mumble #+mumble 1 2 3)

    I would expect '(2 3).  Both implementations I've tried read '(3), which
    is completely unintuitive to me.  Such a thing can easily come up in real
    life (e.g. commenting out with #+(or) something that's already under
    #+mumble).

                          Don Morrison
                          Palladian Software, Inc.

    This is curious.  In the Symbolics 7.0 implementation,
        '(#+non-existent-feature #-non-existent-feature 1 2 3)
        '(#-non-existent-feature #+non-existent-feature 1 2 3)
        '(#+LISPM #-LISPM 1 2 3)
    each read as '(2 3) but
        '(#-LISPM #+LISPM 1 2 3)
    does read as '(3).  This does seem wrong on the following grounds:
        #-LISPM goes into the mode "read me a form, and ignore it."  It
        recursively invokes the reader.
        The reader gets #+LISPM.  #+LISPM goes into the mode "read
        me a form and don't ignore it."

Currently, the Symbolics' reader treats both #+ and #- as "ignore next
form" when *READ-SUPPRESS* is T.  This is probably a misinterpretation
of *READ-SUPPRESS*.  It was done to solve the problem of an illegally
formed expression following a #+ inside a form with *READ-SUPPRESS* 'T.

For example,
  (PROGN
    #+IMPLEMENTATION-X
    (INCF (FROB-KNOB GROZZLE)
      #+SYS:GREEPS-ALLOWED 3
      #-(CAR FGR:*GROZZLE-MODES*) 2)
    ....)

Is the correct interpretation to obey #+ and #- even inside a
*READ-SUPPRESS*?  (while still suppressing errors inside the feature
specification?)

Clearly #+NON-FEATURE (A B #-NON-FEATURE C), shouldn't cause read errors
while reading C.

The question is whether the internal "feature specification" should be
read with *READ-SUPPRESS* bound specially to NIL or not.
If we keep the current binding of *READ-SUPPRESS*, then feature will
always be NIL (*READ-SUPPRESS* causes all extended tokens to be NIL).
If we bind *READ-SUPPRESS* to NIL to read the feature specification,
then syntactic "errors" in the feature can cause errors.

The problem of supporting (by ignoring) non-standard syntax in feature
specifications doesn't need to be part of COMMON-LISP (I don't think
CL allows extensions there), the question of nested #-'s does need to be
made unambiguous.

Implementations (Symbolics' for example) that want to be generous in
what they accept without error, can handle that themselves.

                        This recursively invokes
        the reader.
            The reader reads 1.
        #+LISPM does not ignore the 1, so it returns it as the thing
        read.
        #-LISPM is given 1 as the result of the read, and ignores it.
        2 and 3 are still in the input stream, so I don't know how both
        of them manage to get ignored.

    [I'm not sure what the current state of our mailer is, but I think mail
    addressed to DFM%JASPER@LIVE-OAK.LCS.MIT.EDU will eventually get to me.]

I'm not on the COMMON-LISP mailing list, but someone from Symbolics can
forward to me any replies, if there is some trouble with the return
paths.

    That's very interesting.  In had totally lost track of the files (I
    don't even have a listing!).  Can you give me more info so I can get
    copies of the files?

I include a dired of the directory below.

    I often get requests from people who want a running version, and always
    ask them to let me know if they find one.

Well, I don't know about running.  ITS and Maclisp have both evolved.  You might
be able to find backup versions of the lisp it runs under but ITS changes
would need to be rehacked.  It would probably be simplest to just rewrite
the system in common lisp.  Short of that, you could have somebody rehack
the interface and update the lisp to run in a common lisp.

    And there it was back at MIT all the time! (I had looked on AI, but not
    MC). --t

Well, it was on backup tape and CENT@AI retrieved it for some reason.  Alan
Bawden (Alan@AI.AI.MIT.EDU) can give you substantially more information about
running it again under ITS or finding an old version of Maclisp.  But, it
seems that updating is definitely a better bet.  I would imagine that a
version for PCs might be of value.

So, got any new papers that I want?  Are you going to Hayward's sociology
conference?

         Instructions for Running SHRDLU

     SHRDLU can be in 4 basic states, COMMAND, READY, RUN,
and REQUEST.  It is initially in READY when loaded.

***
******COMMAND STATE
***

     In this state, SHRDLU expects the user to type a command.
It lets you know this by typing ">>>".
A command is a line containing one or more words, separated by
spaces and terminated by two carriage returns (<CR>).  The first
word must be one of the three words SHOW, TELL, or GO.  The
SHOW command is used to ask the system to show such things
as definitions, structures it is building, and the states of various
parameters and switches.  TELL is used to tell the system new
definitions and settings.
     After executing a COMMAND, the system is ready for
another one, and prompts by saying >>>.
You can leave COMMAND state by typing T,NIL, or $P (<alt mode>-P)
instead of a command.  This will cause the program to continue
whatever it was doing before it entered COMMAND
state, or to go to READY state if it was not already in the
process of analyzing a sentence.  If instead, you type the
command "GO", it will drop the sentence it is working on, and go
into READY state for a new one.
      Of course, the COMMAND state is just a slightly-fudged
LISP listen loop, so you can type any atom or S-expression at it
to be evaluted, go from it into the LISP editor, define new functions,etc.

****
******COMMAND FORMATS
****

     The SHOW and TELL commands are based on  trees
(one tree for each).  The first word of the command is SHOW
or TELL, the second names a node in the corresponding tree,
and the rest are any arguments appropriate to the action
at that node.
For example, the command:

SHOW FUNCTION MEET

will display the contents of the LISP function "MEET".

SHOW SHOW

displays the "SHOW" tree, while for the "TELL" tree, you type

SHOW TELL

     If all of the arguments are not specified, the system will
request more.  For example, typing:
SHOW FUNCTION
would cause it to type out:
FUNCTION:
requesting the name of a function from the user.  It is then
in REQUEST state (see below.)
     Non-terminal nodes of the tree may or may not have corresponding
actions.  For example, the command

TELL PLANNER OFF

causes the entire batch of PLANNER tracing devices to be turned off
at once, even though there are subnodes of the PLANNER node which
can be used to turn individual features on and off selectively.
If there is no action associated with such a node, the system will
ask the user to select one of its subnodes.
     If you type "SHOW" or "TELL" followed by two carriage return,
it will guide you through the choices, using REQUESTS
(see below).
     Typing HELP <CR> <CR> will allow you to see this message or
a shorter version which contains just the most salient details of the four states.

*****
*****REQUEST STATE
*****

     SHRDLU can request two kinds of information from
the user.  If it wants him to CHOOSE between a set of alternatives,
it will end the request with a ?.  If it wants him to SPECIFY
a name or list of names, it will end it with a :.
     For a CHOOSE, all it needs is enough information to decide
between the alternatives.  Begin typing your choice, and when it
is complete enough, type a <period>.  If you type fewer
letters than necessary (e.g. typing just a P, when PLANNER
and PARSING are among the choices) it will do nothing and wait
for you to continue.  If you type more than necessary it doesn't
matter.
     For a SPECIFY, type the required response, terminated by a
<CR>.  If you type a <LF> with nothing else, it will take some
default response which is appropriate to the action (For example,
typing a <LF> in response to a request for which properties of an
atomare to be displayed will have the effect of displaying
all of them.
    For either SPECIFY or CHOOSE, you can get more information on
what is expected by typing a ?<CR>.  It will then give you the
request again.  Typing QUIT<CR> at a "SPECIFY" REQUEST or QUIT
<CR> at a "CHOOSE" REQUEST will cause the entire command
of which it was a part to be discarded without finishing,
returning to COMMAND state.

*****
******READY STATE
*****

     The READY state is entered only when a new English sentence is to
be input.  You can tell you are in it when the sytem types
READY
Respond by typing in an English sentence in normal punctuation
(i.e. ending with a question mark or period).
The system will automatically begin processing it, entering
RUN state.  To get into a COMMAND state while entering a sentence,
type  <alt-mode> <alt-mode>.

*****
******RUN STATE
*****

     Whenever a sentence is input, the system begins to RUN.  It
will stop at selected places, entering COMMAND state so the user can
SHOW things and TELL it things before continuing.  There are various
TELL commands which explain how to change these stopping points.
When a T,NIL, or <alt>-P is typed at the COMMAND state, the system returns to RUN
and continues.

     Any word which appears in the SHOW or TELL trees can be
abbreviated by typing its first two letters.  For example,
our first command above could have been abbreviated as:
SH FU MEET
Note that arguments cannot be abbreviated since the system has no
list to check the abbreviations against.  This is also true
of responses to a "SPECIFY" REQUEST.  Responses to a "CHOOSE" REQUEST
are abbreviated by typing any initial letter string followed by
<period> as described above.

§ anno/winograd/mannew

     On the A.I. machine, a reasonably fluent
and debuged version of SHRDLU is alway availlable as
SHRDLU > DSK SHRDLU and can be run as a job
by typing SHRDLU<cntrl. k> at DDT. This version is
in interpreted with
all its options including a grind and trace. Consequently
it occupies arround 200k of core (caution: indiscriminately
running a job that big in the middle of the day is a

good way to make enemies!!!!! Alway check the level
of system usage befoere loading.
.sp 1
     The first sign of life from SHRDLU looks
like this:
          SHRDLU version 101   created on 4-27-73
           type <space> to go to "ready" state, type "?" for help
          >>>
.sp 1
     The version number has certain accessable
information associated with it describing the actual
files used in this version and any phenomena peculiar to it.
the prompt characters ">>>" are produced by the system's
handcrafted real-eval-print loop. When this has
been printed you are boht talking to LISP where you can do any
of the normal things (check values of bound variables, evaluate functions.
etc.) and you can use the SHOW-TELL mechanism which is designed
as a convenient way to fiddle with SHRDLU's knobs & switches,
define new wiords, examine sturctures as they are set up, etc.
More about it later.
     SHRDLU is dumped with all its display options turned
off so that the initial command state is a reasionable place to
set the parameters the way you want them before running any
sentences. All the options will be described in the next
section.
.sp 1
     Moving from this state to the one where
SHRDLU accepts sentences is doen by typing
"t " (the letter "t" followed by a space). The responce
will be:
          READY <cr>
     At this point you can type in a sentence and
it will be interpreted and responded to. Mistyped
letters within a word can bve erased
by typing a <rubout> in the usua; manner and unintended
words can be removed by typing a <rubout> agter an
intervening break character (comma or space usualy). As soon
as the sentence terminating punctuation (. ? !) has been
typed, the sentence is automaticly processed and unless
some display options have been turned on, (or you stumbled across a bug !!)
the next thing that you see will be the
responce to what you typed in from SHRDLU.A switch can be set (see the next section)
to cause a break at this point (immediately
after a response) and
permit the examination of the various structures that were added to the program's
memory for example. Without the break (or after it has been dismissed
we get another "READY" and can continue as before.
     The break-loop (otherwise known as "command state")
can be entered fron the "ready state" by typing <altmode><altmode>
instead of stsrting a sentence. Exiting from it will result
in another "READY".

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SHRDLU
---------------------------

         SHRDLU IS A SYSTEM FOR THE  COMPUTER  UNDERSTANDING
    OF  ENGLISH.    THE  SYSTEM  ANSWERS QUESTIONS, EXECUTES
    COMMANDS, AND  ACCEPTS  INFORMATION  IN  NORMAL  ENGLISH
    DIALOG.    IT  USES  SEMANTIC INFORMATION AND CONTEXT TO
    UNDERSTAND DISCOURSE AND TO DISAMBIGUATE SENTENCES.   IT
    COMBINES  A COMPLETE SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS OF EACH SENTENCE
    WITH A "HEURISTIC  UNDERSTANDER"  WHICH  USES  DIFFERENT
    KINDS  OF  INFORMATION  ABOUT A SENTENCE, OTHER PARTS OF
    THE DISCOURSE, AND GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT  THE  WORLD
    IN DECIDING WHAT THE SENTENCE MEANS.

         SHRDLU  IS  BASED  ON  THE  BELIEF  THAT A COMPUTER
    CANNOT DEAL  REASONABLY  WITH  LANGUAGE  UNLESS  IT  CAN
    "UNDERSTAND"  THE  SUBJECT IT IS DISCUSSING. THE PROGRAM
    IS GIVEN A DETAILED MODEL OF THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED  BY  A
    SIMPLE  ROBOT  HAVING  ONLY A HAND AND AN EYE.  THE USER
    CAN GIVE IT  INSTRUCTIONS  TO  MANIPULATE  TOY  OBJECTS,
    INTERROGATE  IT ABOUT THE SCENE, AND GIVE IT INFORMATION
    IT WILL USE IN DEDUCTION.  IN ADDITION  TO  KNOWING  THE
    PROPERTIES  OF  TOY  OBJECTS,  THE  PROGRAM HAS A SIMPLE
    MODEL OF  ITS  OWN  MENTALITY.    IT  CAN  REMEMBER  AND
    DISCUSS ITS PLANS AND ACTIONS AS WELL AS CARRY THEM OUT.
    IT ENTERS INTO A DIALOG WITH  A  PERSON,  RESPONDING  TO
    ENGLISH  SENTENCES WITH ACTIONS AND ENGLISH REPLIES, AND
    ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION  WHEN  ITS  HEURISTIC  PROGRAMS
    CANNOT  UNDERSTAND A SENTENCE THROUGH USE OF CONTEXT AND
    PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE.

         IN THE PROGRAMS, SYNTAX, SEMANTICS,  AND  INFERENCE
    ARE INTEGRATED IN A "VERTICAL" SYSTEM IN WHICH EACH PART
    IS CONSTANTLY COMMUNICATING WITH THE OTHERS. SHRDLU USES
    SYSTEMIC  GRAMMAR, A TYPE OF SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS WHICH IS
    DESIGNED  TO  DEAL  WITH   SEMANTICS.      RATHER   THAN
    CONCENTRATING  ON  THE EXACT FORM OF RULES FOR THE SHAPE
    OF LINGUISTIC  CONSTITUENTS,  IT  IS  STRUCTURED  AROUND
    CHOICES   FOR  CONVEYING  MEANING.    IT  ABSTRACTS  THE
    RELEVANT FEATURES OF THE LINGUISTIC STRUCTURES WHICH ARE
    IMPORTANT FOR INTERPRETING THEIR MEANING.

         IN  SHRDLU  MANY KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE ARE REPRESENTED
    IN THE FORM OF PROCEDURES RATHER THAN TABLES OF RULES OR
    LISTS  OF  PATTERNS.    BY DEVELOPING SPECIAL PROCEDURAL
    LANGUAGES FOR GRAMMAR, SEMANTICS, AND  DEDUCTIVE  LOGIC,
    THE  FLEXIBILITY  AND  POWER OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES IS
    GAINED    WHILE    RETAINING    THE    REGULARITY    AND
    UNDERSTANDABILITY  OF SIMPLER RULE FORMS.  EACH PIECE OF
    KNOWLEDGE CAN BE A PROCEDURE, AND CAN CALL ON ANY  OTHER
    PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE SYSTEM.

IMPLEMENTATION AND VERSION INFORMATION
--------------------------------------

    SHRDLU  WAS  PROGRAMMED  AT   THE   MIT   ARTIFICIAL
    INTELLIGENCE  LABORATORY  BY  T.   WINOGRAD AS PART OF A
    DOCTORAL DISSERTATION IN MATHEMATICS.

    THE PROGRAM WAS MODIFIED DURING THE LAST YEAR BY  T.
    WINOGRAD,  D.  MACDONALD, J. HILL, AND S. CARD TO CHANGE
    SOME OF ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS  AND  TO  MAKE  THE
    CODE  EASIER  TO UNDERSTAND FOR PERSONS WISHING TO STUDY
    THE PROGRAM.  NO MAJOR ATTEMPTS WERE  MADE  TO  INCREASE
    ITS POWER.

    THE PROGRAM RUNNING AT C-MU IS THE MODIFIED VERSION.
    THE DISPLAY FACILITIES OF  THE  PROGRAM  HAVE  NOT  BEEN
    IMPLEMENTED  AT  C-MU.  THE PROGRAM WAS COAXED AWAY FROM
    MIT'S  INCOMPATIBLE  TIME-SHARING   SYSTEM   (ITS)   AND
    CONVERTED  TO RUN UNDER THE DEC TOPS10 (10-50) OPERATING
    SYSTEM BY CONVERTING MACLISP ITSELF  (AND  TO  DO  THAT,
    CONVERTING  THE  MIDAS  ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE).  THE MACLISP
    CONVERSION WAS DONE BY GEORGE ROBERTSON.

THE VERSION OF SHRDLU BEING DISTRIBUTED FROM  CMU  IS  NAMED
    THE  C1  VERSION.  IT IS CURRENT WITH THE MIT VERSION TO
    JUNE 1972.  THE SHOW AND TELL USER INTERFACE AND VARIOUS
    CHANGES   WERE  ADDED  FOR  THE  C-MU  WORKSHOP  ON  NEW
    TECHNOLOGIES IN COGNITIVE RESEARCH IN JUNE 1972.

    SHRDLU IS  WRITTEN  IN  MACLISP  1.6  (VINTAGE  JUNE
    1972).  IT USES ABOUT 100 TO 140K 36-BIT WORDS OF MEMORY
    ON A PDP-10.

THE SHRDLU DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
-------------------------------

    A  distribution  package  of  the C1 system has been
    make up containing basically

    1. a SAV copy of MACLSP which runs under a version
    of the DEC 10/50 monitor on a PDP-10. TRACE and GRIND
    files are also included.

    2.  a MICROPLANNER (EXPR version)

    3.  a SHRDLU, in two parts.

Together  these constitute a SHRDLU Kit from which it should
    be possible to fashion a full SHRDLU  or  a  parser-only
    system  or  a  MICROPLANNER.   It  is  thought  that the
    package has a good chance of running on any (unmodified)
    10/50  system  or  on  any  other  system  with  a fully
    compatible MACLISP (ha!).

The system currently running at C-mu uses 134K of core,  but
    with  hand  editing this should go down to 100k.  Please
    note that a SAVE file of the system occupies between 800
    and  1000  blocks  of  disk  space.  A SAVE file is not,
    therefor, even remotely close to fitting onto a DECTAPE.

MACLISP:
    MACLISP  has  not been completely implemented.  This
    version is, however, sufficient to run SHRDLU.  A couple
    perversities:

    1. most LISP control characters don't work.  To
    do a <control g> type (IOC G).

    2. Because of an incompatibility problem, UWRITE files
    and (IOC B) printer output are double spaced.

    3. occasionally the garbage collector fails.
    (IOC D) makes it print out every time it is garbage-
    collecting so you can usually figure out what
    happened.  (IOC C) turns off this printout.  To
    get around the garbage collector's always failing
    in the same place in your program, try forcing
    a garbage collect with (GC) so that it gets to
    garbage collect in some other part of your program.

It is possible to obtain a version of MICROPLANNER which has
    been  compliled  into  LAP  in which case you need a LAP
    loader (which comes in both LAP and EXPR versions).  The
    LISP  compiler does work in 10-50 MACLISP so if you want
    to roll your own that is available too.   All of this is
    another good couple of DECTAPES.

SHRDLU is distributed as 2 large files to prevent parts from
    falling off and for ease  in  loading.   The  boundaries
    between  the  traditional  SHRDLU files used for editing
    are indicate by (e.g.)  ;;;[S->GLOBAL]  which  indicates
    the  Start  of a subfile called GLOBAL.  TECO buffs take
    note.

CAVEAT EMPTOR
-------------

This  set  of  probrams  is  distributed  in  the  cause  of
    dissemination of research.  There is no warranty  either
    expressed  or  implied  for  labor, parts, or servicing.
    Various bugs are known to lurk in  the  systems:  SHRDLU
    bugs  +  MICROPLANNER bugs + MACLISP bugs + MIDAS bugs +
    conversion  bugs   +   Monitor   bugs   +   installation
    incompatability  bugs  +  hardware bugs. Furthermore the
    system is presently in a state  of  development  (active
    and  suspended)  with various uncompleted projects here,
    notes to friends there, etc.

ASSEMBLING YOUR SHRDLU KIT
--------------------------

Before you begin assembling a SHRDLU it is probably wise  to
    get a listing of all of files (except MACLSP!!!).  Start
    by listing this one.  It is also helpful to transfer all
    of  the  files  to  dsk.  The names are designed so that
    this  can  be  done  with  pip  in   few   instructions.
    BEWARE!!!!  when  moving MACLSP around with PIP remember
    to use the /B switch.

Also note that the alt-mode which MACLSP looks for  to  tell
    it  that  you are through doing allocation is an 033 and
    not a 175 or 176.  The MACLISP editor also  requires  an
    033.   If  you  don't  have one type <space> after every
    allocation opportunity when entering MACLSP.  And  don't
    type (EDIT) or you'll get stuck.

Below  is  the  TTY listing for building a SHRDLU.  What you
    type is indicated in lower case letters, what  it  types
    in capitals.

..........STEP 7: INITIAL switch settings. Don't you dare.

      At this point SHRDLU will print out a list of some
      its internal switches and invite you to change them.
      The first time you run the program you should probably
      leave them as they are (type space after each arrow).
      Within SHRDLU these same switches can be changed
      with the TELL command.  Or, if you insist, this same
      display can be brought back by evaluating (SW).

      Then SHRDLU will print
READY

..........STEP 8: Saving SHRDLU

      Save immediately before you mung up the nice clean
      core image inside by playing with it.

..........STEP 9: Playing with SHRDLU.

.start

READY
      Now SHRDLU wants to eat a sentence.  And please don't
      forget the proper punctuation, especially the terminal
      punctuation mark at the end. Type sentences in
      upper case.  A capitalization is indicated by (e.g.) =A.
      This is useful for getting proper nouns across to
      the program.  The beginning of a sentence need not be capitalized.

      See Appendices 2 through 6 for examples
 To see if program is running try
      doing

<control x>
LISTENING---> tell parsing node on
*
LISTENING---> <CONTROL X>
READY
PICK UP A BIG RED BLOCK.

      The parser should start happily spewing forth
      trace messages.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING SHRDLU
-------------------------------

     SHRDLU can be in 4 basic states, COMMAND, READY, RUN,
and REQUEST.  It is initially in COMMAND when loaded.

***
******COMMAND STATE
***

     In this state, SHRDLU expects the user to type a command.
It lets you know this by typing "LISTENING-->".
A command is a line containing one or more words, separated by
spaces and terminated by a carriage return (<CR>).  The first
word must be one of the three words SHOW, TELL, or GO.  The
SHOW command is used to ask the system to show such things
as definitions, structures it is building, and the states of various
parameters and switches.  TELL is used to tell the system new
definitions and settings.
     After executing a COMMAND, the system is ready for
another one, and prompts by saying LISTENING-->.
You can leave COMMAND state by typing <CONTROL X>
instead of a command.  This will cause the program to continue
whatever it was doing before it entered COMMAND
state, or to go to READY state if it was not already in the
process of analyzing a sentence.  If instead, you type the
command "GO", it will drop the sentence it is working on, and go
into READY state for a new one.

****
******COMMAND FORMATS
****

     The SHOW and TELL commands are based on a ZOG-like tree
(one tree for each).  The first word of the command is SHOW
or TELL, the second names a node in the corresponding tree,
and the rest are any arguments appropriate to the action
at that node.
For example, the command:

SHOW FUNCTION MEET

will display the contents of the LISP function "MEET".

SHOW SHOW

displays the "SHOW" tree, while for the "TELL" tree, you type

SHOW TELL

     If all of the arguments are not specified, the system will
request more.  For example, typing:
SHOW FUNCTION
would cause it to type out:
FUNCTION:
requesting the name of a function from the user.  It is then
in REQUEST state (see below.)
     Non-terminal nodes of the tree may or may not have corresponding
actions.  For example, the command

TELL PLANNER OFF

causes the entire batch of PLANNER tracing devices to be turned off
at once, even though there are subnodes of the PLANNER node which
can be used to turn individual features on and off selectively.
If there is no action associated with such a node, the system will
ask the user to select one of its subnodes.
     If you type "SHOW" or "HELP" followed by a carriage return,
it will guide you through the choices, using REQUESTS
(see below).

*****
*****REQUEST STATE
*****

     SHRDLU can request two kinds of information from
the user.  If it wants him to CHOOSE between a set of alternatives,
it will end the request with a ?.  If it wants him to SPECIFY
a name or list of names, it will end it with a :.
     For a CHOOSE, all it needs is enough information to decide
between the alternatives.  Begin typing your choice, and when it
is complete enough, type a <control x>.  If you type fewer
letters than necessary (e.g. typing just a P, when PLANNER
and PARSING are among the choices) it will ring the bell and wait
for you to continue.  If you type more than necessary it doesn't
matter.
     For a SPECIFY, type the required response, terminated by a
<CR>.  If you type a <CR> with nothing else, it will take some
default response which is appropriate to the action (For example,
typing a <CR> in response to a request for which properties of an
atomare to be displayed will have the effect of displaying
all of them.
    For either SPECIFY or CHOOSE, you can get more information on
what is expected by typing a ?<CR>.  It will then give you the
request again.  Typing QUIT<CR> at a "SPECIFY" REQUEST or QUIT
<CONTROL X> at a "CHOOSE" REQUEST will cause the entire command
of which it was a part to be discarded without finishing,
returning to COMMAND state.

*****
******READY STATE
*****

     The READY state is entered only when a new English sentence is to
be input.  You can tell you are in it when the sytem types
READY
Respond by typing in an English sentence in normal punctuation
(i.e. ending with a question mark or period) followed by a <CR>.
The system will automatically begin processing it, entering
RUN state.  To get into a COMMAND state while entering a sentence,
type a <CONTROL X>.

*****
******RUN STATE
*****

     Whenever a sentence is input, the system begins to RUN.  It
will stop at selected places, entering COMMAND state so the user can
SHOW things and TELL it things before continuing.  There are various
TELL commands which explain how to change these stopping points.
When a <CONTROL X> is typed at the COMMAND, the system returns to RUN
and continues.

*****
*******ABBREVIATIONS
*****

     Any word which appears in the SHOW or TELL trees can be
abbreviated by typing its first two letters.  For example,
our first command above could have been abbreviated as:
SH FU MEET
Note that arguments cannot be abbreviated since the system has no
list to check the abbreviations against.  This is also true
of responses to a "SPECIFY" REQUEST.  Responses to a "CHOOSE" REQUEST
are abbreviated by typing any initial letter string followed by
<CONTROL X> as described above.

To  see examples of the various commands, run one of the demonstration
programs.  They inclde explanatory comments.

SOME FACTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM
----------------------------

1. PARSER
    SHRDLU calls the parser by calling

    (PARSE <CONSTITUENT-CLASS> LIST-OF-SEMANTIC-FEATURES)

    This causes the 'PROGRAMMAR' program which embodies
the grammar for that constituent-class to be run.  Turning
on the parser trace causes a message 'PASSING ...' to
print out as each node in the grammar for the
constituent-class is passed (with a flowchart or program
listing of the grammar you can follow the parsing path
through it).

    At various points the grammar calls on 'Semantic
Specialists' with the

    (CALLSM <SEMANTIC-SPECIALIST>)

function.  If this function returns NIL, the Semantic-Specialist
objected to the parse.

    As the parser progresses it builds and rebuilds a
parser-tree whose nodes are labeled NODE1, NODE2, ... etc.
When the parse-trace is turned on, these nodes are displayed
whenever they are created or changed.

    The parse-tree is really a complex data structure to
which the syntactic and semantic routines contribute
information as it is developed.

    An important concept is that the surface structure of
the sentence is never destroyed.  The parse-node itself
contains pointers to the beginning (FIRSTWORD) and end
(WORDAFTER) of the constituent in the surface structure.
Whenever the grammar finds it has been partially fooled
and must try another parsing it adjusts these pointers.

2. SEMANTIC-SPECIALISTS

    Part of the work of the Semantic Specialists is to build up
interpretive semantic structures as the parsing of the sentence
proceeds.  The semantic structures built include OSS'S (Object
Semantic Structures), RSS'S (Relational Semantic Structures, TSS's
(Time Semantic Structures) and ANS's (Answer Semantic Structures).
    The Semantic Specialists are all entered through the function

    (CALLSM <SEMANTIC-SPECIALIST>)

from the gramar.

3. INFERENCE MECHANISM - PLANNER

    SHRDLU makes all references to its world model
through the function

    (THVAL2 <MICROPLANNER-STATEMENT>).

The first 2 can only be obtained from the MIT AI Laboratory.
The last is available for this version of MACLISP from me (S.C.) at CMU) as well.
These documents contain what you have to know to really use
MACLISP as a programming system (provided you already know
how to use LISP before you read them).  They are probably not
necessary to run SHRDLU (until you get into trouble).

MICROPLANNER
    1. Winograd's thesis is the best introduction to it.
    2. A manual is available from MIT AI Laboratory.
    3. Ira Goldstein (MIT AI Laboratory) has an excellent
        demonstration program for teaching it.
    4. For the real PLANNER stuff there's Hewett's Thesis
       which has been printed and is available from MIT AI Lab.
    5. Hewett also has several AI Memos and papers in the
       two Int'l Conferences on AI.

    6. Sussman and McDermott and there
       friends have recently created a warring siblisng
       to PLANNER called CONNIVER which is explained in
       two AI Memos.

        or <CONTROL X> to go to COMMAND
COMMAND  (types out LISTENING--->)
     Command terminated by <CR>
      or <CONTROL X> to proceed program
      or GO<CR> to prepare for new sentence
REQUEST  (types out request)
   CHOOSE (request ends with ?)
     Enough of any choice to specify it, followed by
          <CONTROL X>
        or ?<CONTROL X> to see information and choices
        or QUIT<CONTROL X> to abort command
   SPECIFY   (request ends with :)
     Name or list, ended with <CR>
        or just <CR> for default value (if appropriate)
        or QUIT<CR> to abort command
        or ?<CR> for info

§ anno/winograd/files

********************************************************************************
*
*       This describes the files maintained on the directory SHRDLU which
*          go into making up the Natural Language Understanding system designed
*          by Terry Winograd (currently at Stanford University)
*
*       The files are ordered alphabeticly within the directory, but are
*          described here in related groups, and are listed by the printing
*          routine in similar groups
*
********************************************************************************

-- Files which support the BLOCKS micro-world

  BLOCKP >  Microplanner code for essentially all the functions of the
             BLOCKS world. - there are some supplementary materials at the
             end of the dictionary and data files

  BLOCKL >  LISP code to support the microplanner code of BLOCKS. In particular
             this includes the routine for finding space on an object and
             for maintaining the history list.

  DATA >    The initial contents (assertions) of the BLOCKS world's
             microplanner data base. Plus a few addittional function calls
             for initializing all other aspects of the micro-world.

  PLNR 180  This is a complete EXPR code version of MICROPLANNER. Calls to
             MICROPLANNER in SHRDLU are always done by calling the function
             THVAL2, contained in the semantics files, rather than the usual
             call to THVAL. PLNR 180 can be loaded independantly and run
             as a toplevel MICROPLANNER if desired. A compiled version of
             the files is availlable as PLNR FASL on SHRDLU, and TS PLNR on
             SYS should point to a core dump of a toplevel MICROPLANNER

  THTRAC 18 This is a file of tracing routines designed for tracing opperations
             during the evaluation of MICROPLANNER code

--  Toplevel files for the language understanding system --

  SYSCOM >  Contains the toplevel function SHRDLU as well as usefull extentions
             to LISP, special printing functions, break functions, garbage
             collection functions etc.

  MORPHO >  Does all the morphological analysis required in the system via
             the function ETAOIN which is also the function called by SHRDLU
             to read in a user's sentence from the console.

  SHOW >    This is the "Show - Tell" user package developed for use at a
             workshop at CMU in 1972. It provides a convenient way for a
             largely naieve user to interogate and change the data structures
             used in the system. Consult the MANUAL CMU for further details

  SETUP >   A loose ends file for setting global variables, initializing
             trace routines, and setting up the initial environment. It is
             intended to be the final file read into the system before
             making a core dump.

--  Files concerned with syntax

  PROGMR >  This file contains all the functions that comprise the programmar
             language fro writing grammars. It expects to be entered from a
             toplevel call to PARSE as done in SHRDLU, and executes grammar
             programs via an intermediary function, APPLY-GRAMMAR, to permit
             differing opperations in the cases of compiled and intrepreted
             code.

  GINTER >  "Grammar Interpreter" - Contains the calling sequence for use when
             running an uncompiled grammar. A precompiling pass is necessary
             on grammar functions to remove extra levels of function calls
             and to incorporate the calling program used in GINTER to eliminate
             GOTO's out of scope.

  GRAMAR >  The entire syntactic recognition grammar for the system. See
             A.I. MEMO 282 "Grammar for the People" for comprehensive flowcharts
             of the functions in this file.

  DICTIO >  Specifications and entrys for all of SHRDLU's vocabulary and
             related atomic symbols. This file contains all aspects of their
             definitions: syntax, semantics, macro-expanders, etc.

-- Semantics files --

  SMSPEC >  "Semantic Specialists"  This contains all the functions which know
             how to interpret the syntactic forms that will be found by the
             grammar: noun groups, relative clauses, pronouns, etc.. All calls
             to these functions come from the syntactic routines through the
             function SMCALL which is in PROGMR.

  SMUTIL >  Utility routines used by all the semantic functions for building
             nodes, evaluating definitions, marker checks, backreference maintanence,
             quantifier adjusting, building MIRCOPLANNER code.

  SMASS >   Access functions that are used by the two previous files to grovel
             through their data structures while retaining their perspicuity.

-- Answering --

  NEWANS >  "new answer" Code for finding the answers to questions, absorbing
             new information, and following commands, then fromulating the
             appropriate English answers. This code is extensively interfaced
             with MICROPLANNER.

-- Documentation --

  MANUAL CMU, MANNEW >, HELP DOC, MINIH DOC

            These files are unfortunately all the documentation availlable on the
             care and feeding of the system appart from Winograd's book (which is
             far and away the best reference to the details of its opperation).
             MANUAL CMU, as its name implys, was developed for the workshop at
             CMU and it the most through overall guide. HELP DOC and MINIH DOC
             are essentially excerpts from it which were intended as online references.
             MANNEW is grossly incomplete, but it is also the most up to date, and
             covers initial ussage of hte system.

  .INDEX >  This is a through cross-reference for all the LISP code used in the system.
             It lists functions and variables alphabeticly with listings of their
             interactions with the rest of the code (functions called, variables
             bound ...). Also of interest is the file LISP >, which alphabeticly lists
             all MACLISP functions ever invoked in the code and the functions that they
             were invoked from.

-- At the end of the directory, the files whose first names are "Z" are the origninal
    files of the system circa January 1971. They use the old list oriented data
    structures and are essentially uncommented. However they can often be of use
    when trying to see if alternate formulations of some algorithm were ever
    considered.
